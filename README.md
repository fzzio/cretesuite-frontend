# CreteSuite take home ui assessment
This is a take home assessment for the interview process at CreteSuite.

### Overview
A classic matching game, written in React + Typescript.

This repo contains a boilerplate matching game. Your task is to make it actually functional. The desired features are:
1) After clicking two cards, if the cards MATCH then keep them visible, if the cards do NOT match then hide the cards.
1) Add a "turns" counter for tracking how many attempts were made to complete the game. A turn is considered flipping a pair of cards.
1) Add a "You Won" message after completing all the matches
1) Implement any other UI, UX, Typescript, or code quality improvements you'd like.

As an optional step, feel free to add other features you might see useful, such as allowing the user to pick between dogs and cats or maybe a reset button. Just have fun with it.

And of course, if you are passionate about dogs vs cats, please make your choice known by returning the corresponding api in `getApiUrl`.

Upon completing a solution, please open a Pull Request detailing relevant context or decisions you made.
